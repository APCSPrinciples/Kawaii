Use the instructions below as a guide in designing your own Kawaii character. You may also want to look at the full list of functions at [p5js.org/reference/](https://p5js.org/reference/).

Optional: Rotating the arms
---------------------------
Here's a basic figure with arms straight at the side.

Notice that we are using `rectMode(CENTER)` so the left arm is center at (125,300). Rotations are always about the origin, so we first need to `translate(125,300)` to move the origin to the center of the left arm. Then we can `rotate(.1)` to rotate the left arm a small amount in the clockwise direction. After draw the left arm, we need to "un-rotate" and "un-translate" in reverse order so that the rest of the drawing is uneffected.
